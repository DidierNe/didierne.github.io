## 🧠 Selected Projects

### Visual Field Denoising (Master Thesis)  
🧠 Deep learning model combining RNFLT and VF inputs to reconstruct clean perimetry maps for glaucoma progression analysis.

### Salamander Robot Force Platform  
🐾 Designed a waterproof setup to measure ground reaction forces during amphibious locomotion in a bio-inspired robot.


### Hate Speech Detection  
💬 NLP classifier trained on social media content using a DistilBERT model with interpretable attention maps.
### Mini-Segway (Bachelor Capstone Project)

🧲 Designed and built a self-balancing two-wheel robot from scratch in a 3-person team.  
I was in charge of the embedded system (PID control, sensor fusion, motor control, hardware integration).
