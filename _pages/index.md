Robotics engineer graduating in Sept. 2025 â€” currently completing my Masterâ€™s thesis at the [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/)  
EPFL graduate-to-be, passionate about deep learning, medical imaging, and real-world impact.

ðŸ’¼ Open to full-time opportunities starting Fall 2025


## ðŸ”¬ Experience

**Harvard Medical School â€” Researcher @ Ophthalmology AI Lab**  
*Feb 2025 â€“ Aug 2025, Boston, USA*  
Masterâ€™s thesis on visual field denoising using multi-module deep learning networks for glaucoma diagnosis.  
Also contributing to collaborative lab projects on medical LLMs and augmented reality (Meta/Aria glasses), with a focus on data preparation and experimental support.

**Data Science & Applied Mathematics Intern**  
*Rolex SA, Bienne (2024)*  
Worked on computer vision in a highly confidential industrial setting.  
Focused on data preprocessing and model design under strict privacy and security constraints.




## ðŸ§  Selected Projects

### Visual Field Denoising (Master Thesis)  
ðŸ§  Deep learning model combining RNFLT and visual field data to reconstruct clean perimetry maps and improve glaucoma progression analysis.  
*This work is ongoing at [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/) and may lead to a publication â€” details withheld for confidentiality.*
