Robotics engineer graduating in Sept. 2025 — currently completing my Master’s thesis at the [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/)  
EPFL graduate-to-be, passionate about deep learning, medical imaging, and real-world impact.

💼 Open to full-time opportunities starting Fall 2025


##  Experience

- **Harvard Medical School — Researcher @ Ophthalmology AI Lab**  
  *Feb 2025 – Aug 2025, Boston, USA*  
  Master’s thesis on visual field denoising using multi-module deep learning networks for glaucoma diagnosis.  
  Also contributing to collaborative lab projects on medical LLMs and augmented reality (Meta/Aria glasses), with a focus on data preparation and experimental support.

- **Data Science & Applied Mathematics Intern @ Rolex SA**  
  *Aug 2024 – Feb 2025, Bienne, Switzerland*  
  Worked on computer vision in a highly confidential industrial setting.  
  Focused on data preprocessing and model design under strict privacy and security constraints.

- **Teaching Assistant — Computational Motor Control @ EPFL (BioRob Lab)**  
  *Feb 2024 – July 2024, Lausanne, Switzerland*  
  Assisted Master’s students in a course led by Prof. Auke Ijspeert.  
  Supported weekly exercises and final projects on neural CPGs and locomotor control in Python.





## Selected Projects

- ### Visual Field Denoising (Master Thesis)  
Ongoing research project at [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/), focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to denoise sparse clinical signals.  \
The goal is to improve visual field (VF) quality by suppressing structured noise and learning meaningful representations through a multimodal deep learning pipeline.  \
Evaluation focuses on reconstruction fidelity, robust regression metrics, and longitudinal consistency with anatomical structures.  \
*Research in progress — models and evaluation pipelines are actively under development.*




- ### Salamander Locomotion Setup  
Developed a waterproof experimental setup to record ground reaction forces during amphibious locomotion of salamanders in 3D.  
*Master’s Semester Project (10 ECTS, grade 6/6)*  
**Skills:** Embedded systems, data acquisition, hardware prototyping.

- ### Mini-Segway Robot
Built a self-balancing two-wheeled robot from scratch with a 4-person team.  
**Contributions:** Control system design and electronics integration.  
*Bachelor Project (Grade: 5.75 / 6 – 5 ECTS)*  
*The robot was able to autonomously stand and balance.*
