## Selected Projects

- ### Visual Field Denoising (Master Thesis)  
Ongoing research project at [Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab](https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/), focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning to denoise sparse clinical signals.  \
The goal is to improve visual field (VF) quality by suppressing structured noise and learning meaningful representations through a multimodal deep learning pipeline.  \
Evaluation focuses on reconstruction fidelity, robust regression metrics, and longitudinal consistency with anatomical structures.  \
*Research in progress — models and evaluation pipelines are actively under development.*




- ### Salamander Locomotion Setup  
Developed a waterproof experimental setup to record ground reaction forces during amphibious locomotion of salamanders in 3D.  
*Master’s Semester Project (10 ECTS, grade 6/6)*  
**Skills:** Embedded systems, data acquisition, hardware prototyping.

- ### Mini-Segway Robot
Built a self-balancing two-wheeled robot from scratch with a 4-person team.  
**Contributions:** Control system design and electronics integration.  
*Bachelor Project (Grade: 5.75 / 6 – 5 ECTS)*  
*The robot was able to autonomously stand and balance.*
