## 👋 Hi, I’m Didier Neuenschwander

I’m a robotics engineer from EPFL (Switzerland), currently completing my master’s thesis at the Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab.  
I focus on deep learning, computer vision, and medical imaging — particularly in real-world settings where data is limited and uncertainty is high.
