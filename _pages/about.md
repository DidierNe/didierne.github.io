## 👋 Hi, I’m Didier Neuenschwander

I’m a robotics engineer from EPFL (Switzerland), currently completing my master’s thesis at the Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab.  
My work focuses on deep learning, computer vision, and medical imaging — especially in real-world conditions with limited data, uncertainty, and clinical constraints.

## 🧠 Current Research

**Visual Field Denoising in Glaucoma**  
*Harvard Ophthalmology AI Lab (2025)*  
I am developing a deep learning pipeline to denoise visual field tests using multimodal data (OCT + clinical fields), aiming to improve robustness and diagnostic value in glaucoma care.

## 💼 Past Experience

**Data Science & Applied Math Intern**  
*Rolex SA, Bienne (2024)*  
Worked on computer vision tasks in a confidential industrial context. Focused on preprocessing, model design, under strong data privacy and security constraints.
