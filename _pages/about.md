Iâ€™m a Swiss engineering student from the Nord Vaudois region, currently completing my Masterâ€™s in Robotics at EPFL. My academic interests lie in computer vision and AI, especially when applied to real-world challenges that can have concrete impact â€” such as in healthcare.

I deeply enjoy sharing knowledge. From 2021 to 2024, I supported a private organization assisting vocational trainees, guiding a small group of four youths in electronics and project work. It was a rewarding opportunity to help others grow while reinforcing my own skills through teaching.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, skiing, running, and skateboarding. Iâ€™ve always liked building things myself, often tinkering with electronics or side projects just for fun.

Iâ€™m also someone who loves to travel and connect with people from different backgrounds. Iâ€™ve done backpacking in Asia, and I chose to do my Masterâ€™s thesis in Boston not just for the academic opportunity, but also for the chance to explore a new culture and community. Meeting new people and learning from diverse perspectives is something that drives me â€” both personally and professionally.

I completed my military service in Switzerland as an artillery fire direction soldier.  
Iâ€™m fluent in French (native), confident in English (C1), and conversational in German (B1).
