I'm a Swiss engineering student from the Nord Vaudois region, currently completing my Master's in Robotics at EPFL. My academic interests lie in computer vision and AI, especially when applied to real-world challenges that can have concrete impact â€” such as in healthcare.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, skiing, running, and skateboarding. Iâ€™ve always liked building things myself, often tinkering with electronics or side projects just for fun.

Iâ€™m someone who loves to travel and connect with people from different backgrounds. Iâ€™ve done backpacking in Asia, and I chose to do my Masterâ€™s thesis in Boston not just for the academic opportunity, but also for the chance to explore a new culture and community. Meeting new people and learning from diverse perspectives is something that drives me â€” both personally and professionally.

I completed my military service in Switzerland as an **artillery fire direction soldier**, and I speak French (native), English (C1+), and German (B1â€“B2).
